2) **Choose categories**: Select up to three categories that best describe your place. [Here you can read the category descriptions](https://help.tripadvancer.com/categories).
3) **Provide a detailed description**: Explain the value and attractiveness of the place so that others understand why it’s worth visiting.
4) **Upload a quality image**: Choose a clear, beautiful cover photo. There should be no people in the foreground of the cover photo, please do not upload images with people or selfies.
5) **Add up to 10 photos**: This will help enhance the description of the place.
